# Sample migrations

These are some example migrations that can be placed on your local migrations folder (`/migrations`) to get your event started.

Make sure you check the existing values to update the settings to your specific needs.

Once you have copied the files you can apply your custom migrations by running `./backend/yii migrate-red`
