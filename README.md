echoCTF is a pioneer computer security framework, developed by
Echothrust Solutions, for running CyberSecurity exercises and competitions such
as Capture the Flag.

echoCTF allows building and running capture the flag competitions for network
penetration testing and security auditing on real IT infrastructure. It is
also used for security awareness and training purposes, by businesses and
educational institutes.

# What is echoCTF.RED
echoCTF.RED <sub>(codename Mycenae),</sub> is the first iteration of our online
long running CTF service, based on the applications from this repository.

It is a free online service that offers a controlled environment, based on
real-life systems and services, to train and sharpen your offensive and
defensive security skills. Scan, brute-force and do whatever it takes to
attack the systems and solve the real-life security scenarios to gain points.

For more information about our competitions visit [https://echoCTF.com/](https://echoCTF.com/) or if
you'd rather see a live example of our platform feel free to visit [https://echoCTF.RED/](https://echoCTF.RED/)

Our main goals for echoCTF include:
* **Completeness** - Provide a complete set of tools and applications to develop, deploy and maintain competitions
* **Modularity** - Each component has a unique and clear role
* **Expandability** - echoCTF's components are designed to permit expansion

## Quick start
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/echoCTF/echoCTF.RED.git
$ cd echoCTF.RED
$ docker pull echothrust/echoctf.red-db:latest
$ docker pull echothrust/echoctf.red-backend:latest
$ docker pull echothrust/echoctf.red-frontend:latest
$ docker pull echothrust/echoctf.red-vpn:latest
$ docker-compose up
```
_NOTE_: The following ports will be binded localy `1194/udp`, `8080/tcp`, `8082/tcp`, `3306/tcp`, `11211/tcp`. If any of these ports are already in use the applications will fail to start.
