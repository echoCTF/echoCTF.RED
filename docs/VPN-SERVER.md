# VPN Server Installation

The VPN server for the platform is the system that allows participants to
connect to the target infrastructure as well as keeping track of the findings.

The following guide covers the installation of the needed applications on
OpenBSD 7.7 to act as a VPN gateway.

Before you start ensure you have the db server up and running as the VPN needs
to connect to the database server to operate. Check the [DOCKER-COMPOSE-NOVPN.md](DOCKER-COMPOSE-NOVPN.md)


The following network details will be used throughout this guide

* vpn server egress interface: `em0`
* vpn server egress address: `172.26.0.1`
* vpn server targets interface: `em1`
* vpn server targets address: `10.0.160.254/24`
* vpn server tun0 address: `10.10.0.1`
* vpn server assigned range: `10.10.0.0/16`
* targets network: `10.0.100.0/16`
* mysql/memcache server: `172.24.0.253`

There is an experimental playbook you can run locally on your OpenBSD that will
configure all that is needed for you.

Before you start ensure you are able to access your existing database from the
server by running something like the following
```sh
nc -zv 172.24.0.253 3306
nc -zv 172.24.0.253 11211
```

**NOTE:** If you're using the supplied `docker-compose` without VPN this IP will be
the IP of the docker host and not the container.

```sh
pkg_add -vvi git ansible
git clone https://github.com/echoCTF/echoCTF.RED.git
cd echoCTF.RED/ansible
ansible-playbook runonce/vpngw.yml
```

Once you answer the questions asked you are set to go.

If you rather to execute the playbook in a non interactive mode, copy the
file `examples/default-settings.yml` and edit it to match your setup.
```sh
cp examples/default-settings.yml settings.yml
ansible-playbook runonce/vpngw.yml -e '@settings.yml'
```

Restart the system and
once it comes back up following the instructions at
[After restart](#after-restart) and you should be up and running.

## After restart

Set the mail FROM system configuration key
```sh
./backend/yii sysconfig/set mail_from dontreply@example.red
```

Note that in order to allow registrations from the web interface you need to
also set the following sysconfig keys
```sh
./backend/yii sysconfig/set mail_fromName	"Mail From Name"
./backend/yii sysconfig/set mail_host smtp.host.com
./backend/yii sysconfig/set mail_port 25
```

Create a backend user and a frontend user by executing the following commands
```sh
# backend user
./backend/yii user/create username email password
# frontend player
./backend/yii player/register "username" "email" "fullname" "password" offense 1
```

Keep in mind that by default the system comes up in `maintenance` mode, which means
that services are only accessible to `administrators`. You can remove the maintenance
mode by flushing the `<maintenance>` pf tables eg: `pfctl -t maintenance -T flush`.

If you want to make the change permanent remove the contents of `/etc/maintenance.conf`.
